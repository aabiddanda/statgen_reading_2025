StatGen Reading Group 2025
==========================

This is an *unofficial* course website for a reading group on statistical genetics - held in the summer of 2025 in the Department of Biology at  Johns Hopkins University.

The primary functions (learning goals) of this reading group are to: 

* have dedicated time to learn about the fundamentals underlying modern statistical genetic approaches
* understand study design considerations for genetic studies 
* work together on problem sets mirroring common problems encountered in quantitative/statistical genetic research

The course material and notes are abbreviated from two key resources: 

1. Matti Pirinen's GWAS Course Notes: https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/mjxpirin/GWAS_course/

2. Handbook of Statistical Genomics: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119487845
